# Tensorflow certification exam from coursera

This repo contains the code of my study/review journey with coursera tensorflow developer course. <br>
Instead of using Google colab like the course, I run python files and notebook locally to replicate the testing environment since the exam require test taker to use PyCharm.

The code contains in this repo is largly the same as the notebooks within the course. The main difference is the path when using the flow_from_directoy function.

## Courses
- Course 1 - Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
